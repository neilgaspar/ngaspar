				<h2>Labs</h2>
				<p>This section will hold various Labs, starting with lab 2 which is about Mobile Application Development Tools.</p>

				<h3>Lab 2: Mobile Application Development Tool</h3>
				<table border = "1" width="80%">

						<th colspan="2">
							Development Tool
						</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td width="25%"><b>Tool Name:</b></td>
						<td>Xamarin</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Platform:</b></td>
						<td>Xamarin allows you to make applications for multiple platforms. These platforms are iOS, Android, Windows, Mac and more.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Application Development Type:</b></td>
						<td>
							<b>Type:</b>
							<br/>
							Xamarin is a Cross-Platform development tool.
							<br/>
							<b>Advantages:</b>
							<br/>
							The advantages that are gained from being a cross-platform tool is that code share allows you to build
							an application and use the same code for multiple platforms.
							<br/>
							<b>Disadvantages:</b>
							<br/>
							The general disadvantages to cross-platform development have been alleviated, meaning that the only real
							disadvantage is any hardware requirements as needing a mac computer to make iOS applications if using Windows.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Website:</b></td>
						<td><a href="https://www.xamarin.com/">https://www.xamarin.com/</a></td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Developers:</b></td>
						<td>
							Xamarin has over 350+ employees but not all are developers. Nat Friedman, Miguel de Icaza and Joseph Hill are 
							the founder and co-founders respectively they developed and still are working with Xamarin.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Release Date:</b></td>
						<td>The date that I could find closest to the release date was when it was announced on May 16, 2011.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>License:</b></td>
						<td>
							The license differs based upon what version of Microsoft Visual Studio you are using along with 
							what classification of whether you are an individual versus a organization. To find the terms that
							apply to you, they can be found at <a href="https://www.xamarin.com/license">https://www.xamarin.com/license</a>.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Price:</b></td>
						<td>Xamarin is free to download. The only thing you may possibly pay for is a different version of Microsoft Visual
							Studio (other than Visual Studio Community) which is not associated with the cost of Xamarin.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Programming Language(s):</b></td>
						<td>C# and F# for mobile development, where C# is the most common</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Features:</b></td>
						<td>
							It has Native like perfomance and is able to access the native api so that native user interfaces can be created. 
							It can share code between types of devices (iOS, Android, Windows Phone). You can use Portable Class Libraries.
							Using Xamarin and publishing you app you can make you app available to 2.6 billion devices.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Debugger:</b></td>
						<td>
							Uses the Visual Studio Debugger.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Built-in Emulator:</b></td>
						<td>
							Android SDK Emulator
							<br/>
							Google Android Manager
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Machine Requirements:</b></td>
						<td>
							Either macOS or Windows and Visual Studio for the respective OS. If you have a Windows Machine and are trying to
							develop a iOS application then you must have a macOS computer on the network (or VM). No real minimum requirements
							although some features are only available if running certain OS'. Running Windows 10 gives access to all features 
							and macOS Sierra 10.12 for mac.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Integrated Development Enviroment:</b></td>
						<td>Xamarin uses Microsoft Visual Studio as it's IDE.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Software Required:</b></td>
						<td>
							The only software required is Visual Studio which will be installed with xamarin if it is not already installed.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Advantages:</b></td>
						<td>
							One IDE and shared code to design applications in multiple platforms. It is free. Simplified maintence since it
							is shared code. Close to Native Performance.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Disadvantages:</b></td>
						<td>
							If you want the features from the other versions of Microsoft Visual Studio you will need to buy them.
							Larger App Sizes due to the packaging that Xamarin applies to the application. Delayed Support for latest
							platform updates.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Language Availability:</b></td>
						<td>
							"English, French, Spanish, German, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, and Brazilian Portuguese languages." (Xamarin, 2018) are the
							basic languages and more can be added.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Uploading and Selling an App:</b></td>
						<td>
							There are many steps to uploading and selling an app, first of which is making sure that the required documentation
							is provided the app must describe its functionality and that it has a unique app key. Then once this has been done 
							multiple locations is can be published to, such as Google Play, Amazon App Store, to a website to download, and through
							email. Each method has specific advantages but their methods should be checked when publishing to make sure that all
							rules are followed.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Third-Party Emulator:</b></td>
						<td>
							Genymotion is an Android emulator and costs $136/year or more depending on license but appears to be
							a more common third party emulator that is used. The emulator has some unique features like the ability
							to emulate the internal drive of a device.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Market Share:</b></td>
						<td>
							I was not able to find a market share number for xamarin.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Number of Apps Available:</b></td>
						<td>
							The actual number of is unknown but for apps in the stores in 2015 it was put at 1.75 million apps with 
							an expected 3.6 million apps at the start of 2018.
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Number of Downloads/Users:</b></td>
						<td>
							The number is unknown but was stated for apps that teens download ~6.3 apps per month and adults download 1 app 
							per month which is for all apps regardless of what is was developed in.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Learning:</b></td>
						<td>
							They have a thing called Xamarin University to help teach users to use Xamarin where you can get lectures and 
							other material to learn from. They have two packages for this and 1 is free the other is $83.25USD /month. The 
							paid package gives you the ability to get a certification and 1 on 1 meetings with instructors to get help.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td><b>Interesting facts</b></td>
						<td>
							Xamarin says that over 15,000 companies relie on Xamarin such as 3M, HoneyWell, Outback SteakHouse just to name a few.
