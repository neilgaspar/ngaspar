                Welcome to my home page, from here you can go to my other pages which are about various sports. The sports available to view are
                snowboarding, formula 1 and lastly hockey. Each page will tell you a bit about each sport and the equipment needed for the sports
                like hockey. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Each page will talk a little about what equipment is needed and how to get into the sport. From each respective page it will have 
                links to sites that are about the sport and you may find interesting. For example, Formula 1 will have a link that will take you to
                the Formula 1 website where you can see news about the sport.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are many more sports than the ones covered on my site and many of them are also very exciting and have large followings,
                such as soccer or football depending on where you are from. 
            </p>
