            <p>
                Welcome to my page about Formula 1. Formula 1 is a very prestigious racing league that very few drivers ever reach as their are 
                only approximately 20 drivers in a given season. Although, there are some drivers that will race for a race here or there over 
                the season. The current drivers for the 2018 season can be seen <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2018/drivers.html">here.</a>
                Below you can listen to the sound of a Formula 1 cars racing.

            <h3>Points System</h3>
            <p>
                So, how do you score points in F1 (formula 1), there are various amounts of points awarded to a driver based on the position
                they finish the race in. First place recieves the most at 25 points, followed by second with 18 points and third with 15.
                The lowest position you can finish in and still recieve points is 10th and you will recieve 1 point. The driver at the end of the
                season with the most points is the drivers champion. Seperate from the driver points is the Constructor Standings which each team 
                will be on, this can be seen <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/results.html/2018/team.html">here.</a>
                Each team or constructor has 2 drivers, and at the end of the season like the drivers there is a constructors champion. This is 
                determined by how well each driver performed per race. So, the max points that can be earned for a constructor in any single
                race is 25 points from the first place driver and 18 points for the second place driver totaling 43 points.
            </p>

            <h3>Tips for drivers aspiring to be a Formula 1 Driver</h3>
            <p>
                The first thing if you want to become a professional driver is that you need to start racing young. This is because like anything
                the more you practice the better you become. You may say wait how do I get driving experience if I'm to young to drive a car. Well
                start out driving go-karts it will help you learn to control a vehicle and it will help you get used to racing others.

            </p>

            <p>
                One thing that also needs to be considered is how much money you can spend on attaining this dream as it is very expensive. 
                It is very hard to get into F1 and you need to race in lower divisions of racing before you get a chance at Formula 1. Even,
                racing at a lower level is very expensive as Daniel Ricciardo a current driver took out loans from the bank that were over
                $250,000+ in order to obtain a position on one of these teams.

            <h3>What do they Wear</h3>
            <p>
