        <h1>Welcome to Neil Gaspar's Information Page</h1>
        <p>
            This page is for the purpose of completing Classwork 3 of Mode 4201. In this page 
            are the various tasks to complete Mode 4201 Classwork 3 which include a youtube video,
            multiple pictures, audio file and a video file.
        </p>

        <p>
            The topic I have chosen to put on this page to display the various html5 elements and how they can be used in a
            responsive webpage is Cats. Since, there are so many types of cats I have chosen to use the following types of cats:
            Domestic cats, Serval cats, Lions, and Cheetahs.
        </p>
        
        <br/>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="cat">
                <img class="catimg" src="./images/domestic.jpg" alt="Domestic Cat"><br/>
                Domestic cats come in many breeds, and many people also have cats as pets which they are usually one of these breeds.
                Cats tend to sleep a lot. Also, cats can have very different personalities, which can also depend on whether
                they have other cats in the household. Before they reach adulthood, they are called kittens.
            </div>

            <div class="cat">
                <img class="catimg" src="./images/serval.jpg" alt="Serval Cat"><br/>
                Serval cats are much bigger cats than a domestic cat. They also have large ears, also they can jump really high.
                Serval cats are wild cats although some people do own them as house pets, but they do require significantly more
                maintenance than a regular domestic cat.
            </div>

            <div class="cat">
                <img class="catimg" src="./images/lion.jpg" alt="Lion"><br/>
                Lions are generally regards the king of the kingdom. I think they are overrated. Although, their manes
                are very pretty and they do have a magnificent roar. The female lions do not have a mane and they are the 
                hunters of the pack.
            </div>

            <div class="cat">
                <img class="catimg" src="./images/cheetah.jpg" alt="Cheetah"><br/>
                Cheetahs are my favorite animal, they can run really fast. They only chase after prey that
                they know they can catch otherwise they won't waste their energy. Also, when they are cubs
                they are very cute. As cubs they are playful and this helps them learn to hunt.
